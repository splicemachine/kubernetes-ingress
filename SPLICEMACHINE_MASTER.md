# Splicemachine Fork of https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress

We will keep our local `master` branch in sync with the parent master, pulling down change into our repository.
We will create our master branch as `sm_master`.  We will merge changes from our local `master` down into `sm_master`
We will create working branches off of `sm_master` and merge our modifications into the `sm_master` branch.  
Our customized Docker images will be built from the `sm_master` branch.
